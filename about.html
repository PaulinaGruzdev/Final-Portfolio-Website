<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
</div>
<div class="abouttext">
<p2>Hello my name is Paulina Gruzdev.
  I am a student at CalArts, majoring as a graphic design.
  I have an interest in motion graphics since I did a lot of animation.
I enjoy exploring new options for myself. As of recently I got into making my own music
and I've been playing around on garage band. It's very nice to meet you stranger.</p2>

    <h3>Fun</h3>
    <hr>


    <p>On my own time I like to create my own projects with my own insterests. Oddly enough I only create my own work when I want to avoid work given to me. Such an interesting motivation.</p>
